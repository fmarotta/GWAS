# GWAS

In order to understand something, nothing is better than making a 
program of it. This time, we wanted to understand how a genome-wide 
association study (or GWAS) was conducted. An article series published 
on Nature Protocols has provided invaluable notions on the general 
principles of case-control association studies, and the work we made in 
this repository is strongly based upon that series, especially on the 
[last paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3154648/) 
(from which you can get to the other three).

As of now, the parts on preliminary analysis, quality control and 
results displaying are yet to be implemented; the program, nonetheless, 
works for sample data, which can be downloaded from the teaching 
material of PLINK at the URL 
http://zzz.bwh.harvard.edu/plink/res.shtml#teach, or from 
http://www.well.ox.ac.uk/ggeu/NPanalysis/, which is provided by the 
authors of the article series mentioned above. When we say 'works', we 
mean that the correct associations are reported.

Let me disclaim that I am not a real programmer, and this is not a real 
program, but just an exercise I did for myself in order to understand 
GWAS. For any comment or request, however, you can contact me.
